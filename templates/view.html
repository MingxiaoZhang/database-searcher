      <td>Approximately 70–85 % of primary liver cancers are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), tumor cells can be characterized at single-cell resolution. Angiogenesis plays a significant role in tumor formation. There is an urgent need for an angiogenesis-related gene prediction signature to evaluate the prognosis of HCC patients. In this study, 179 angiogenesis-related genes (AngRG) were differentially expressed between primary and metastatic HCC. Transcriptome and clinical data were further gathered on HCC from TCGA and ICGC. A ten AngRG signature and risk score model was constructed to predict the outcome of HCC. A competing-risk nomogram was created using the cancer status, which was accurate and predictive. We also compared two risk score groups for somatic tumor mutational burden (TMB). The results showed that AngRG high-risk scores were linked to the TP53 mutation. According to the xCell analysis, the risk profile predicted immune cell infiltration in HCC. Additionally, enrichment of N-glycan biosynthesis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, RNA degradation, the mTOR, and the cell cycle signaling pathways was identified in the AngRG high-risk group of HCC. Overall, scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq were used to develop a 10-gene signature (including CYP27A1, S100A10, S100A9, SQSTM1, FGB, CLDN6, CNN3, HMGCS2, CYP3A5, and RGCC) to predict the overall survival of HCC patients.</td>

There is an urgent need for an angiogenesis-related gene prediction signature to evaluate the prognosis of HCC patients.

Additionally, enrichment of N-glycan biosynthesis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, RNA degradation, the mTOR, and the cell cycle signaling pathways was identified in the AngRG high-risk group of HCC.
